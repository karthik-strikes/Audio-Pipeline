It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

            "[00:00:003.13] [SPEAKER_01] So in this study, people are participating from across the US.  To get started, I like to understand a little bit more about your community and surroundings  to help me understand more about where you're coming from in your context.  So can you tell me a little bit about where you live?\n",
            "[00:00:023.84] [SPEAKER_00] Sure, I live in Erie, Pennsylvania.  The population is approximately $100,000.  Or $100,000 people.\n",
            "[00:00:058.96] [SPEAKER_01] You\n",
            "[00:01:003.55] [SPEAKER_00] Excuse me.  And I live alone and I have a house of my own  and I live outside of the city, but not in the suburbs.  I'm just something outskirts of the city,  very close to the suburbs.  I live in a semi-quiet neighborhood  and that's all I guess, I don't know.\n",
            "[00:02:012.01] [SPEAKER_01] How would you describe your neighborhood to someone who doesn't live there?\n",
            "[00:02:012.50] [SPEAKER_00] Sure. Well, when I bought my house 25 years ago, it was very, very nice and quiet. It  was a lot of elderly retired people that took pride in their homes and so forth. But in  the 25 years that I have lived here, they have all of my surrounding neighbors at least,  one has passed and either their family has moved in or they have sold their homes and  they've sold it to people that don't have the scruples that the original owners had.  So their homes are in a bit of disarray and their behavior is not quiet.  So I have a healthy relationship with the non-emergency police number because I'm not  going to tolerate anything in my neighborhood and that's it.\n",
            "[00:03:029.45] [SPEAKER_01] moment.\n",
            "[00:03:040.52] [SPEAKER_00] Um, the man that bought the house to two houses down from me, like the third day  he, they moved in and on the third day he parked his van on the road on the street.  And the third day he moved in on the third day, his van got hit in the night  and like really crushes van up and they drove away and that nothing like that  has ever happened ever in this neighborhood.  And absolutely not his fault whatsoever, but I went right over and he didn't know  me and I didn't know him and I introduced myself as his neighbor and I told him  that has never happened in this neighborhood before.  So don't think that he moved into a bad neighborhood right off the bat.  Um, I was pretty happy about that.  And, um, my neighbor next door to me, uh, her mother owned the home and then she,  got it and she remodeled it or whatever and she's great.  Um, but she's getting up there now and she's getting sick.  So, um, I go and take care of her, take care of her quite a bit.  Uh, every time I'm out shoveling, I shovel her driveway and her sidewalk  and steps and brush her car off.  And so I try to help out, try to be a good neighbor.\n",
            "[00:04:054.09] [SPEAKER_01] Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And where do you spend most of your time?\n",
            "[00:05:003.70] [SPEAKER_00] I am more of an introvert.  Um, when I don't, I volunteered on a tall ship, uh, that was in the area for about 15  years and a lot of my focus was on that volunteerism because being on the boat  sailing was just lovely.  I thought it was great.  So I was down there volunteering all the time when I wasn't working.  And, um, but they, in the winter time, they do inside work, but there's  been some controversy, the boat got sold and blah, blah, blah.  And there's lots of drama and I don't like drama.  So I have stayed away for probably about a year now.  And, um, so I, I stay indoors, uh, mostly.  Um, I do for others, but I don't like to do for myself.  So I go and help my friends do things.  And, um, and then when I get home, I don't want to do anything at my own home.  Uh, so I'm trying to chip away at getting my, my home horn home organized.\n",
            "[00:05:006.28] [SPEAKER_01] Hmm.\n",
            "[00:05:006.48] [SPEAKER_00] Am I getting off track? I'm sorry.  No, no, these answers are perfect.  You know how every...\n",
            "[00:07:059.90] [SPEAKER_01] Yeah.\n",
            "[00:08:017.96] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.  So what are your surroundings like in your neighborhood?  Is it walkable?  Is there a lot of green space?\n",
            "[00:08:019.78] [SPEAKER_01] Great.\n",
            "[00:08:025.10] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.\n",
            "[00:10:003.72] [SPEAKER_01] Um, well, there's, well, right across the, uh, two houses down is, um, uh,  more of a main road and directly across from that is the back, uh, yard.  I don't know what to call it of there.  There's a grade school on the corner.  And so it's a great big green space, but, um, the, and they used to have a  right here on the side of the kind of busy road and I got to see it and I got  the kids, see the kids play on and so forth, but they, uh, of course got rid  of that one and got a new one and the new play play, whatever that's called  that the kids swing on and stuff.  Uh, they moved it to the other side of the field.  Um, but it's a city school and, uh, I mean, there's good and bad and everything.  Um, and I'm, unfortunately I see a lot of the bad, uh, I'm working on that.  I'm trying not to, I'm trying to focus more on the good.  Um, but there's, uh, and it's like, it's an elementary school, but the kids are,  you know, it's a city school and they're, you know, pretty crass and rude and,  you know, one, they throw rocks at my house and one time and they, I was out  working in the yard to one day and the kids were walking by on the sidewalk  and they threw like a pile of dirt at me or something.  And, um, but I'm trying to focus on the positive and, uh, I like the  green space of the yard and then just a couple more blocks down, maybe three  blocks down, there's a dog park with trails that you can walk in.  It's just very pretty for being in the city.  It's surprising that it's there.  But I don't go there very often.  I really don't get out much, but, uh, I mean, I've been there several times.  It's beautiful.  And I appreciate the green space I do have, but, but now on one side of my  helm is the corner yard, so they have a great big yard, their house is  waist on the other end of the yard.  And then on the other side of my house, it's like 15 feet.  The house, the other house is like right there.  And I, I don't like that.  Even though that's where the good neighbor lives, that's where  Susie lives and she's great.  And I'm very, very, very grateful for that.  That that house that's 15 feet from mine is, has a neighbor that's real good.  And I, I take care of her quite a bit, so I'm happy about that.  Okay. Well, thank you for sharing a bit about where you live in your community.  Now we're going to talk about health care services and providers in your area.\n",
            "[00:11:019.00] [SPEAKER_00] Cheers.\n",
            "[00:12:012.78] [SPEAKER_01] So can you walk me through the last time that you saw a doctor?  Well, I had, okay, I'm going to have to think about that.  Oh, I know.  I had to have, oh, I know.  Okay. It was in November and I broke my hand just a little bit, but I broke it in one  of the metacarpals or metatarsals or whatever it's called.  And we were leaving for Florida to my dad's Florida home because I clean it for him.  He rents it out and then I go back and I clean it from top to bottom.  And we were leaving in two days and I broke my hand and the doctor said I could wear a  cast for six weeks or he can put a pin in my hand and then I wouldn't have to wear a  cast. Well, we were living for Florida in two days, so I didn't want to wear a cast.  So I went into surgery to put the pin in and it was a real big deal.  I guess I didn't realize it was going to be such a big deal.  But, you know, I got completely put under and they had to put a great big pin in my  hand and my hand filled up like a balloon.  So I guess I'm sorry, I'm giving you, I don't know if I'm supposed to be telling all  these details, but yeah, it was in November.  And then I had an appointment in December for a colonoscopy and for a mammogram, but  I've rescheduled those into January just because I had too much going on.  So November.\n",
            "[00:12:033.75] [SPEAKER_00] Okay. And again, feel free to give as much as you want for each answer.  There is no wrong way to answer.  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:037.07] [SPEAKER_01] \n",
            "[00:12:039.42] [SPEAKER_00] is where do you normally go for yearly checkups?\n",
            "[00:12:053.45] [SPEAKER_01] Okay. My PCP, um, is who I would normally go to in that since September is my yearly  checkup. Um, so I see her again in September and I think it's September and, um, she's,  uh, all the way across town, but I mean, that's 20 minutes. Erie is not that big. So even  across town is, you know, 20 minutes away. And, uh, uh, so I don't go, even though it's  only 20 minutes away, I don't go that way very often, but I do go whenever I have an  appointment to see her. And my next one is in September and I love my PCP. She's great.\n",
            "[00:13:006.88] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.\n",
            "[00:14:033.48] [SPEAKER_01] And where do you go when you usually fail set?\n",
            "[00:14:047.38] [SPEAKER_00] Um, boy, how do I say this?  I am very aware of what I put in my body.  Uh, and I really tried to have a very healthy diet.  Um, so I can't tell you when the last time I was sick.  Um, I, when I am sick, I don't go anywhere anyways.  you know, rest, stay, you know, just stay in bed for a couple of days or whatever.  Um, yeah, I don't go to the doctor very often at all.  Stuff doesn't happen to me very often.  I don't get sick very often.  Well, I mean, I broke my hand.  That was a thing.  I haven't done that ever.  Uh, but I don't get cold very often.  I can't tell you when the last time I had a cold was or flu or any of that, you  know, I ate vegetables for breakfast and weird stuff like that.   Okay.\n",
            "[00:18:003.14] [SPEAKER_01] And so the last time that you saw a doctor and that experience that you were describing  before, how far did you have to travel to see that provider?\n",
            "[00:18:000.79] [SPEAKER_00] the one in November or the my PCP?\n",
            "[00:18:050.34] [SPEAKER_01] November.\n",
            "[00:19:001.91] [SPEAKER_00] November. They're closer. They're kind of in the middle. I probably had a go maybe,  well, no, they're more than in the middle. They're closer to me. They're not far, maybe  within five miles.\n",
            "[00:19:014.65] [SPEAKER_01] Okay.\n",
            "[00:19:015.14] [SPEAKER_00] So for beyond a normal health or sick visit,  where do you usually go?\n",
            "[00:19:025.01] [SPEAKER_01] Um, I don't really go anywhere.  I got poison ivy real bad.  Like two or three years ago.  Um, I just thought it would go away and thought it would go away, but  it just, I looked like a elephant man.  I was, I had it all over my arms and all over my, my side.  And well, I went to the emergent care for that.  Um, I've never been to emergent care before or urgent care or whatever it's called.  You know, the walk-in medical facility and I, I went there, but  I've never been there before.  I don't have a, like a go-to, I don't get sick regularly enough.  I mean, if I did get sick, if I, if I, well, I had salmonella like 15 years ago  and I didn't go to the doctor, I just stayed in bed, you know, for like about a  week and, you know, let it go through its course or whatever, but I don't go to the doctor.  I mean, I very rarely go to the doctor.  So I don't have a regular, like, if I get the flu, I go to this doctor.  I had nothing like that.  I mean, if I were to get the flu, I would stay home and have more liquids and eat  more vegetables and take more probiotics.  I wouldn't go to the doctor.  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:005.42] [SPEAKER_00] in your PCP, were you able to choose them as a provider?  Or what did that process look like?\n",
            "[00:21:049.93] [SPEAKER_01] Yes.  It was a long time ago I picked her for my provider.  I had one who was my DCP, but she switched networks  or my insurance switched or something had happened,  I remember.  And I couldn't go to her anymore,  even though I wasn't, she was just right up the street.  She wasn't far at all.  But I couldn't go to her.  So I had to pick a different one.  And so I picked this woman and she's been my PCP ever since.  And she's great.  I believe it was, I don't know.  I don't know how I found her, but I found her and I love her.  I mean, I want a woman doctor and I  want a doctor that's affiliated with a hospital  that my mother retired from and my sister retired from.  We have a particular hospital in the family, so to speak.  So I go to doctors that are affiliated with that hospital.  And she was a woman and I think I love her.  She's great.  But I just picked her from the, I don't really remember,  but a list of people that were accepting new patients  because I was a new patient because I had to switch doctors.  And that's all.  Okay.  And so like when you saw that provider in November.  Yes, was insurance something that you had to consider.\n",
            "[00:25:021.60] [SPEAKER_00] Yes\n",
            "[00:26:022.01] [SPEAKER_01] No, I don't have a job at the moment.  I'm in between and I'm on the Medicaid, I guess it's called,  because I don't have a good income.  I have had, of course, jobs and had insurance,  but not when this happened in November.  And I'm actually, I don't really know how to feel about it,  but I'm thankful because I don't really understand Medicaid,  other than it's free for me.  But they cover everything.  I mean, or they cover just about everything.  I hardly have to pay anything out of pocket, which when I had insurance  through my previous employers, I remember I've had quite a bit to pay.  So this time in November when I broke my hand, there was no issue.  But I recall, I remember, like in 2006 or something, a long time ago,  I was working and had insurance and my in-laws were coming over for lunch  and I was cutting tomatoes with a big long serrated knife and I whacked right  into my finger and chopped it and I didn't chop it in half, but I had a huge,  huge cut and I just wrapped it up and held it.  And then I was on the phone with my insurance company trying to figure out  where do I go, how much do I have to pay?  You know, and that was, I remember that was just awful.\n",
            "[00:26:022.32] [SPEAKER_00] Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[00:26:032.69] [SPEAKER_01] I wasn't going to die. It wasn't life threatening. You know, I mean, I just had a big cut on  my finger, but I had to go to the emergency room and they had to pull a doctor out of,  out of her practice to come and a plastic surgeon to come and fill my finger up or whatever.  And, uh, but I remember before I went, I remember I called my doc insurance, you know, and you  get the run around and I was transferred here and transferred there and I didn't know what  to do. And I remember I was so upset. I was crying because I didn't know, I mean, how  much is this going to cost me a million dollars? I didn't know what to do. So it wasn't a factor  in November, but I recall when it has been a factor, but this most previous time, no.\n",
            "[00:26:046.24] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.\n",
            "[00:27:010.68] [SPEAKER_01] And so now when you need care,  would you say that you're able to get it?\n",
            "[00:27:029.82] [SPEAKER_00] Yes. I mean, I'm always able to get it, but it's just unbelievably convenient now  that I have this government insurance, whatever it is, when you're on low income.\n",
            "[00:27:058.05] [SPEAKER_01] Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[00:27:058.65] [SPEAKER_00] because they cover just about everything and I didn't know that.\n",
            "[00:28:003.60] [SPEAKER_01] And so how much do you trust doctors  and the doctors that you've seen?  And can you tell me more about why you feel this way?\n",
            "[00:28:016.31] [SPEAKER_00] Sure. Well, when it's a physical thing, like when I cut my finger way back when,  or I tore my ACL in 2010, and I didn't have insurance for that, and that was a hot mess.  That was a very complicated situation because I didn't have insurance  and I didn't know anything about Medicaid.  And I had a lot of complications because I didn't take care of my injury properly.  But anyways, when I have a physical, you know, broke my finger, tore my ACL, well, no,  I didn't go to the doctor for that.  That's not a good one.  But broke my foot, whatever.  And I go to the doctor.  I trust what they say.  They say, you know, you can get a cast, have a pin, whatever.  I believe what they say.  But when I go to, I see a counselor.  I've seen many psychologists and psychiatrists and counselors over my, the period of my life.  And I really don't trust what they say.  So mental health, I don't believe what they say, but physical health, I do.\n",
            "[00:28:043.88] [SPEAKER_01] And if you feel comfortable sharing,  can you tell me why that is?\n",
            "[00:28:046.12] [SPEAKER_00] Yes, probably number one, because I don't understand,  I'm sure.  I'm sure it's operator error and my fault.  I'm sure I just don't understand what they're saying  or I mean, denial.  At least I have succumbed to the fact  that I have depression now and I'm taking some sort of drug  to help me with that.  And, but I didn't for the longest time  and I was, it really was a much, much poorer quality of life.  I did not wanna be on any pharmaceuticals.  And so I didn't, even though I knew something was wrong,  I was out of hand.\n",
            "[00:28:048.40] [SPEAKER_01] hand.\n",
            "[00:29:002.10] [SPEAKER_00] My depression took the form of anger and it took me over a decade to figure out that I  needed to be on some sort of...  I think that's where my PCP came in.  She put me on some sort of...  In fact, yeah, she did.  She put me on some antidepressant thing.  It's called Prozac.  And...  Well, see?  Okay, okay.  I have to think about this more.  I'm sorry.\n",
            "[00:30:006.75] [SPEAKER_01] Ah.\n",
            "[00:30:021.99] [SPEAKER_00] Like, I don't believe what counselors or docs,  I haven't been a psychiatrist or psychologist in a while,  but I go to a counselor and I'm very wishy washy  as far as mental health goes,  because I don't accredit the person  giving me the information.  I don't trust that they know,  I trust that they've been to school  and I trust that they have all the language,  but I don't believe that they know me or know,  I don't believe that they promote a better way  of finding good mental health,  with your diet and exercise and meditation  and mindfulness and yoga and all that stuff.  They just wanna slap you on drugs.  And plus now that I'm at the age I'm at,  my counselor says other things.  I've been through trauma and blah, blah, blah.  And I have been, I guess,  but I don't really understand cognitive behavior  and all that stuff.  I mean, I'm trying to understand it,  but so I guess the bottom line is,  I don't trust mental therapy,  mental health doctors much  because I don't trust that they really know  what they're talking about with me.  I trust they're smart and all that.  They went to school,  but I don't trust that I am in their best interest.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Now my PCP and my, that's different  because I need a cast, I broke my hand, whatever.  I need to get a pen or whatever.  But when it comes to mental health,  I feel my whole life I've just been swept under the rug.\n",
            "[00:30:024.98] [SPEAKER_01] Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[00:30:049.06] [SPEAKER_00] Thank you for sharing.  You're welcome.  So do you feel like your doctors listen to your concerns like you're the doctors you  saw for your cats and your PCP?\n",
            "[00:31:053.25] [SPEAKER_01] Yes.  Yes, I do.\n",
            "[00:32:005.25] [SPEAKER_00] And how much do you trust the recommendations or advice  from a doctor regarding your health?  I know you were explaining that it looks different  depending on the specialties.\n",
            "[00:32:023.81] [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that's correct.  For the most part, the only recommendations I get  from doctors I take, you know, like the specialist,  I need a pin if I don't wanna wear a cast, whatever.  But as far as the counselor goes,  she thinks I should be on all kinds of,  well, maybe she doesn't.  But she definitely thinks I have way more  mental health issues than I believe I do.  And she thinks I should go on disability,  and I don't think that's, you know, I'm not,  as soon as she said that, she lost a lot of credibility  with me because I've never ever, ever have thought  of myself as someone that would be on disability.  But she seems to think I have issues enough  that I should be on it.\n",
            "[00:32:025.79] [SPEAKER_00] Hmm.\n",
            "[00:32:051.54] [SPEAKER_01] So my doctors, I take their advice,  my counselor, therapist, whatever, I do not.\n",
            "[00:32:055.08] [SPEAKER_00] \n",
            "[00:33:009.04] [SPEAKER_01] Right.  And is there anything that will make you more or less likely  to follow that doctor's recommendations  when it comes to making decisions for your health care?\n",
            "[00:33:019.68] [SPEAKER_00] I researched what they say and for the most part, I understand it and I do,  that's why I do their advice.  But if I don't understand it and I don't agree with it, I don't take their advice.  Did I say that right?\n",
            "[00:33:026.88] [SPEAKER_01] Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[00:33:038.79] [SPEAKER_00] Thanks.\n",
            "[00:33:051.01] [SPEAKER_01] And how satisfied do you feel with the quality of your care overall?\n",
            "[00:34:000.57] [SPEAKER_00] Um, my Western medicine doctors, I feel, you know, maybe, maybe 85%.  And with my mental health, I, it's like 40%.  I don't really believe what they say or want to do what they say.  or trust them at all, really.\n",
            "[00:36:018.78] [SPEAKER_01] Okay.\n",
            "[00:36:021.85] [SPEAKER_00] Has there ever been a time where you felt like you were being treated unfairly as a patient?\n",
            "[00:37:041.82] [SPEAKER_01] Um, only I think, again, when I look back when I have in the past, when I've gone to  doctors for mental health, I don't feel at all like they were giving me the right advice  or taking care of me.  Did I say that right?\n",
            "[00:38:027.03] [SPEAKER_00] No, yeah, I understand what you're saying.  And how, if at all, did this experience influence  how you view the healthcare system?\n",
            "[00:39:015.90] [SPEAKER_01] Well, 100%, 100%, even though I love my PCP and she's great.  I mean, she's still a doctor  and they're just out to make money.  And she's at least a little bit on my side  with not wanting to take medications  for every little thing.  And, but I think the rest of the world,  all my friends and people I know,  their doctors just slap them on every prescription  and they take a dozen pills a day.  And I don't, I just, I think the whole,  the whole, I think it's a racket.  I believe that doctors are out to help pharmacy,  farmers and it's just about making money.\n",
            "[00:39:016.10] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.\n",
            "[00:39:051.78] [SPEAKER_01] Thank you for sharing about your experiences.  Before we move to the next section, is there anything else that you want to share  about your experiences with healthcare?\n",
            "[00:40:002.29] [SPEAKER_00] No.\n",
            "[00:40:025.07] [SPEAKER_01] Okay, and we can come back as well if there's something that comes to you like to mention.  But okay.  Next, I'd like to learn more about how you make decisions for your health.  Can you tell me about when you needed to find information in order to make a decision about your health?\n",
            "[00:40:035.92] [SPEAKER_00] Yes, it's very confusing for me, perhaps because of my age or my, I like to think I'm fairly  intelligent and I have pretty okay education. But when I search things on the internet,  it's just a bombardment of information or I never, I don't know very often what to trust and what to  believe. So I talk to my friends and family more than anything to find out about stuff.  I research it online, but you know, the internet's just so huge and you get two billion hits for one  medical question and so I kind of, I research like home remedies as well.\n",
            "[00:40:041.52] [SPEAKER_01] Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[00:40:046.60] [SPEAKER_00] and I try to stick with those.  So I guess I research it by the internet, I guess.  We could say the internet and my friends and family.\n",
            "[00:41:016.72] [SPEAKER_01] Okay.\n",
            "[00:41:031.11] [SPEAKER_00] And when you say that, internet, where do you look  and how do you figure out  if the information is reliable or not?\n",
            "[00:41:033.36] [SPEAKER_01] Yep, okay.  Well, I just opened a tab,  which my search engine is Bing,  only because of the fact that it was on the Today Show  way back when, and they show that pretty picture every day,  so that's the only reason why I do Bing.  Um, cause it's, and then I just type in the bar, what the thing is that I need to find.  And then it comes up and then that's when I get confused because there's  just so many responses.  So I look at the first several and then, uh, like kind of see what.  Correlates between them all, what information is the same and then, or not  them all, but the first couple that I pick, and then I also\n",
            "[00:41:056.41] [SPEAKER_00] you know.\n",
            "[00:42:003.50] [SPEAKER_01] look at how to do it at home, you know, like what things you can eat to help your health  and so forth.\n",
            "[00:42:004.01] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:021.57] [SPEAKER_01] So is this how you find health information or is that a process?\n",
            "[00:42:022.03] [SPEAKER_00] Yes.  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:43:021.48] [SPEAKER_01] Yes, on the internet.\n",
            "[00:43:021.95] [SPEAKER_00] Okay, and is there, or so where else specifically do you look?  Like is there certain websites you look for, forums?\n",
            "[00:44:013.47] [SPEAKER_01] No.  So, no.  Like, are you asking if I go to like WebMD or whatever or any of those kind of things?\n",
            "[00:44:014.22] [SPEAKER_00] Well, any websites, forums, or sources that you,  that maybe is your go-to.\n",
            "[00:44:035.86] [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, it's not.  I don't have one.  I mean, I don't get sick enough to be  savvy about looking medical things up.  Plus, like that WebMD, I don't believe hardly anything  they say, because I'm sure it's just a big racket to get you  to buy something for money.  And I don't know what information is.  Is it true what they say on WebMD?  I mean, I'm sure it's not all lies,  but I'm talking myself into the corner here.  I don't trust WebMD.  The bigger the website or whatever, the less I trust them.  So no, I don't have a go-to, because I don't do it often  now.\n",
            "[00:45:004.13] [SPEAKER_00] Can you tell me a little bit more about your reasoning for that when you said the bigger  the website, the least likely you are to trust them?\n",
            "[00:46:005.72] [SPEAKER_01] Yes, I can tell you more about that.  My experience has been from my, I'm sure limited,  but my knowledge on the world or the world in the United States\n",
            "[00:46:019.19] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.\n",
            "[00:46:046.00] [SPEAKER_01] And I'm not going to say this right, but like Monsanto, okay, I hear they're real bad and  they own like everything.  And they put poisons in their food to make it taste yummy in your kids cereal and you  know, they use all sorts of chemicals and all this bad stuff.  And they own like just about everything.  And I think the bigger the conglomerate, the less likely they have for your best interest.  It's all about making money.\n",
            "[00:46:050.11] [SPEAKER_00] And why do I want to buy coffee creamers that have 15 ingredients when I can just put sugar  and vanilla and heavy cream together and make my own?  Why do I need to have 52 ingredients in my, I buy plant-based vegetable soup, okay?  And sugar is the third ingredient.  Like what is that about?  Why is sugar in vegetable soup?  You know, I just don't understand why companies, I think the bigger the company,  the more they're out to make money and they eat.  They use not real ingredients and not clean ingredients and, but they make food  that tastes good and people don't pay attention.  And so they buy it because it tastes yummy.  But I think that their larger companies are out to make money  and they don't care about people.\n",
            "[00:47:001.21] [SPEAKER_01] Okay.\n",
            "[00:47:023.51] [SPEAKER_00] What do you think most people use to find information?\n",
            "[00:47:030.61] [SPEAKER_01] Probably like the big like WebMD or whatever the other ones are like WebMD.  I don't know because I don't look, but I think that people just go and they're like sheep.  You know, they just go and just follow whatever information it says  and they pop all the pills that the doctor says they should take instead of, you know,  researching it and eating, I don't know, eating kale for breakfast instead  of cinnamon Cheerios or whatever.\n",
            "[00:47:037.22] [SPEAKER_00] I know.\n",
            "[00:48:043.96] [SPEAKER_01] I think that people want that America, that American society dictates the easier way,  like just the easy, just pop a pill.  Then you don't have to worry about your salt intake and your, you know, any of that stuff  because they have a pill for everything, just about.  I live a hard life because I don't want to pop a pill for everything that's going on.  If something's wrong with me, which there are tons of things wrong with me, you know,  I try to work at it to help myself with better, with healthier options.\n",
            "[00:48:044.74] [SPEAKER_00] My\n",
            "[00:49:041.52] [SPEAKER_01] mindfulness and meditation and you know instead of just in my diet you know eating kale for  breakfast and\n",
            "[00:49:057.66] [SPEAKER_00] having raisins for dessert, you know, not eating a tub of ice cream and, you know,  it's, it's, I think that, I don't know, now I'm getting off track.  So I think that the American public is dictated by society to do  just easy stuff like pop pills.\n",
            "[00:49:058.99] [SPEAKER_01] And so some people's first choice may be to go to social media to find health information.  What are your thoughts on that?\n",
            "[00:50:002.36] [SPEAKER_00] Yes. I think that that's not good at all. I don't think that's a reliable source. I think that anybody can say anything, of course, on social media, and  it's not a reliable source.  So have you ever seen health information without looking for it?\n",
            "[00:51:028.38] [SPEAKER_01] Oh yeah, oh my gosh, these pop-up ads?  Yeah, all the time.\n",
            "[00:51:029.05] [SPEAKER_00] If you can give me an example, what kind of information?\n",
            "[00:51:030.70] [SPEAKER_01] Um, so, okay, I have to think about it because I try to block all.\n",
            "[00:51:035.32] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.\n",
            "[00:51:037.99] [SPEAKER_01] Oh, boy.  An example.  I'm sorry, can I have a minute to think about that?  I'm not sure I have to think about that.\n",
            "[00:51:044.41] [SPEAKER_00] Yeah.\n",
            "[00:52:024.80] [SPEAKER_01] Do you think that we could come back to that one?  Yes, we can.\n",
            "[00:53:023.29] [SPEAKER_00] Thank you.\n",
            "[00:54:007.14] [SPEAKER_01] Of course.  And so earlier you mentioned, you know,  staying away from those bigger websites or bigger sources.  What about Reddit?  Is that a source that you've used before?\n",
            "[00:54:022.00] [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so.\n",
            "[00:54:038.10] [SPEAKER_01] I used Reddit one time.\n",
            "[00:54:048.87] [SPEAKER_00] Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[00:55:024.27] [SPEAKER_01] One time. Okay. On how to... No, I don't do drugs and I don't know much about them,  but I always had wondered how crack was made. How do you do crack or how do you make crack?\n",
            "[00:55:032.24] [SPEAKER_00] Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[00:55:036.74] [SPEAKER_01] I looked on the Reddit and there was some guy in New York City and he did the whole  thing in real time or whatever.  And I watched him, it was like 15 minutes long.  And I watched it and now I know that's the only time I've ever used Reddit and I will  never use it for anything ever again, just because of that fact that it showed me if  I wanted to make crack, I know how to now.  Like that's terrible.  That is horrible.  I mean, it's bad enough that I wanted to, that I even was curious enough to know how  to make it.  I've always wondered.\n",
            "[00:55:047.07] [SPEAKER_00] Like that.\n",
            "[00:57:042.27] [SPEAKER_01] But I mean, what kind of social media place would have a video of a man making crack?  No.  So, I mean, I guess I'm a tiny bit thankful because now I know, but the majority,  absolutely why would you have that?  That's terrible.  What if someone that had a problem or a child or something saw that?  And I'm sure they have.\n",
            "[00:57:048.48] [SPEAKER_00] Mm-hmm.  I think that's so Reddit.  No, I have no faith in them at all.  Like, uh-uh.  But I,  I'm to the point now where I can't believe  that this is me in my life.  I never thought that this would be my life at my age,  but I like to watch animal shows,  and I watch funny kitty videos, and I watch cooking.  I watch tons of cooking shows.  My grandma always watched cooking shows,  and my dad always watched, like,  nature shows and history channel,  and I hated that, and now that's all I do.  So I don't get a lot of,  it doesn't, okay, what is it?  Not the algorithm, but, you know,  how they give you videos that are in sync  with the ones that you've already watched.  So I get.  Mostly, you know, kitty cat videos and like rated G videos.  I don't get, you know, I don't look at bad stuff so bad.  No, I don't look at negative things very often.  So negative pop-ups don't happen.  Okay.\n",
            "[00:59:014.97] [SPEAKER_01] And say if that pop-up work happened or some sort of ad  that was health-related or even seeing it on the billboard  somewhere, how would you decide that was a trustworthy source  or not?  Do you look into public health care or?\n",
            "[00:59:027.73] [SPEAKER_00] Okay.\n",
            "[00:59:048.43] [SPEAKER_01] You\n",
            "[01:00:004.87] [SPEAKER_00] I look into the bigger the company and the more advertising they have, the least I trust  them.  Because again, I think the bigger the, the more times I see the same commercial over  and over and over, I think that that's the company, of course, is trying to like brainwash  the public or whatever, trying to get the public's mindset into, oh, you have to have  that.  And I have friends, you know, they watch all the commercials and oh, they got to do all  the stuff that all the commercials say.  And I think that's terrible, you know.  So I don't trust the more I hear from them, the least I trust them because they're too  big and too much of a conglomerate and who knows who owns them.  And the bottom line, I'm sure it's just about money.\n",
            "[01:00:040.36] [SPEAKER_01] Okay.\n",
            "[01:01:005.03] [SPEAKER_00] And before we move on to the next section, is there anything else that you want to share  about online health information?\n",
            "[01:01:028.99] [SPEAKER_01] I think that I wish that most people didn't trust everything they saw.  I wish that they could spend the time and do the work to research better.  Not just, oh, it says take this pill, I'll take that pill, you know, whatever.\n",
            "[01:01:036.95] [SPEAKER_00] \n",
            "[01:02:037.70] [SPEAKER_01] only.\n",
            "[01:02:056.07] [SPEAKER_00] I wish the public were more educated about advertisements.\n",
            "[01:03:005.40] [SPEAKER_01] Okay. Thank you for talking to me about your experiences getting healthcare and information.  In this last section, we'd like to talk about your experiences with social media.  Can you tell me about how you interact with other people on social media or online more generally?\n",
            "[01:03:022.34] [SPEAKER_00] I can. I of course have all the social media accounts, but at my age I don't really know  how to work the TikTok or the Instagram very often, so all I do is watch pity videos and\n",
            "[01:04:016.68] [SPEAKER_01] I don't know.\n",
            "[01:04:023.83] [SPEAKER_00] cooking videos and stuff. But I do interact. We have family that lives out of state and  she just had a second baby. And so we she does a lot of social media. And so that's  how we get to see the babies and her and you know, we miss her, of course. And so we do  don't interact. I don't, excuse me, I don't interact very often. But I look at them all  the time, you know. So my use of social media is with my family. Well, it's not even really  my family, but it's with friends that live far away and we can stay in touch. But I don't  know how to do. I mean, I watch all the videos, well, not all the kitty cat videos and cooking  videos on TikTok, but I don't know how to do that follow stuff. What's that mean? And I don't,  you know, and I don't care to know. If I wanted to know, I could and I, but I don't care.\n",
            "[01:04:051.10] [SPEAKER_01] Thanks for watching!\n",
            "[01:05:003.30] [SPEAKER_00] So a lot of my friends have deleted their social media accounts because it's just so  negative and so much drama.  And you know, I'm down to, and I don't want 9,000 friends of people that I don't know  who they are.  You know, you're only my friend if I actually know you and I like you.  So I don't have that many and most of the time the ones that have stayed on social media,  you know, I don't care to know what your cat did or, I mean, I'm not really following  much on social media.  I like to turn it on once in a while and see what they're up to, but it's, you know, it's,  I don't do social media very often.  I don't like it very much.  Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[01:06:001.77] [SPEAKER_01] And where do you spend most of your time online?\n",
            "[01:06:007.95] [SPEAKER_00] Most of my time online. Okay.\n",
            "[01:07:010.12] [SPEAKER_01] Well, let's look at what I got going on now.  Of course, I have, you know, TikTok, Facebook, eBay,  YouTube, I have all those things up.  I don't look at them often.  OK, wait, what do I spend my most time on?  I think perhaps, OK, all right, OK.  We're talking about currently, correct?  I currently spend the most time on YouTube.  At first, for years and years and years,  I thought YouTube was just terrible.  But you can search things that you want that are good,  you know, about meditation or about diets.  And so I've been doing a lot of YouTube.  Is that social media?  Now, is it?\n",
            "[01:07:020.06] [SPEAKER_00] I don't know.  Some people would consider it social media,  but it is somewhere online, so it counts.\n",
            "[01:07:023.94] [SPEAKER_01] Okay, so you mean like, okay, so like Facebook or TikTok or Instagram or\n",
            "[01:07:029.37] [SPEAKER_00] Okay, okay, okay, I got it.  Well.\n",
            "[01:07:033.60] [SPEAKER_01] I guess I spend the most time, you asked what I spend the most time on, right?\n",
